In the original TKF91 paper Maximum estimate of mu for ancestral sequence i given as 0.1.
we fix this mu and for lengths 50, 500 and 5000 we choose lambda=mu*length of ancestor sequence/(length of ancestor sequence+1)

for 50
lambda=0.1*50/51=0.098

for 500
lambda=0.1*500/501=0.0998

for 5000
lambda=0.1*5000/5001=0.0999
